# Mercury backtesting suite

This is a stub of a very simple backtesting framework in Python.
It is conceived to make life easyier when writing strategies, as such its performance is totally crap right now and it's probably not working as intended yet.

The trading simulation should be rewritten and the all the data strutures used in the simulation kept in a single dataframe to archieve acceptable performance.

**Short-term TODO:**
- [ ] Logging
- [ ] Comment everything
- [ ] Doctest
- [ ] Simple example strategies
- [ ] Add some test data
- [ ] Useful data import
- [ ] Results printing

**Medium-term TODO:**
- [ ] Add better results analysis
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Kind of flexible data import
- [ ] Some not-so-crappy performance in the simulation

**Long-term TODO:**
- [ ] Add documentation
- [ ] Expose useful functions from third-party libraries to strategies
